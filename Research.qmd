My research interests are currently focused on the intersection of comparative political behavior & institutions and quantitative methodology. My substantive interests specifically looks at the ways in which institutional arrangements shape voters' preferences among parties. I supplement this with methodological research questions about the ways to improve our ability to estimate the effects of institutional arrangements on voters and accurately estimate the spatial and spatio-temporal effects of institutions on voter behavior.
