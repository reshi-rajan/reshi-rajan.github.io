My research interests are currently focused on the intersection of comparative political behavior & institutions and quantitative methodology. My substantive interests specifically looks at the ways in which institutional arrangements and policies shape voters' preferences among parties. I supplement this with methodological research questions about the ways to improve our ability to estimate regression models with a particular emphasis on time-series, spatial, and time-series cross-sectional data.
