    "text": "Howdy! I am Reshi Rajan, a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government in College Station, Texas. My substantive research interests are primarily in the intersection of comparative political behavior & political economy — specifically how economic institutions and features impact voter turnout and vote choice. My methodological research interests are focused in quantitative methodology — particularly maximum likelihood estimation and time-series, spatial, and panel/TSCS data analysis. I completed my B.A. in International Affairs with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Georgia in 2023 as well as my M.A. in Political Science."
