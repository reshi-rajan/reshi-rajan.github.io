    "text": "Howdy! I am Reshi Rajan, a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government in College Station, Texas. My substantive research interests are primarily in the intersection of comparative political behavior & political economy — specifically how economic institutions and features impact voter turnout and vote choice. My methodological research interests are focused in quantitative methodology — particularly maximum likelihood estimation and time-series, spatial, and panel/TSCS data analysis. I completed my B.A. in International Affairs with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Georgia in 2023 as well as my M.A. in Political Science."

    "text": "My research currently focuses on both substantive and methodological interests. My substantive interests are in comparative political behavior and political economy, specifically looking at how electoral behavior is affected by economic institutions and features. I supplement this with methodological research questions focused on the ways we can improve our ability to estimate and interpret regression models with a particular emphasis on time-series, spatial, and time-series cross-sectional data.\n\nPublications\n\nRajan, Reshikesav, and Shane P.
