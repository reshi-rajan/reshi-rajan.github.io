    "text": "Howdy! I am Reshi Rajan, a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government in College Station, Texas. My research interests are primarily in the intersection of comparative political behavior & institutions — specifically the effects institutional arrangements have on voters — and quantitative methodology — particularly maximum likelihood estimation and time-series, spatial, and panel/TSCS data analysis. I completed my B.A. in International Affairs with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Georgia in 2023 as well as my M.A. in Political Science. In addition to my research interests in political science, my interests in pure mathematics focus on Number Theory, specifically arithmetic in the Quaternions."

My substantive interests specifically looks at the ways in which institutional arrangements and policies shape voters’ preferences among parties. I supplement this with methodological research questions about the ways to improve our ability to estimate regression models with a particular emphasis on time-series, spatial, and time-series cross-sectional data.\n\nMA Thesis\nMy MA thesis looked at which voters follow How To Vote cards in Australia; it can be found at this link.\n\n\nWorks in Progress\n\nDoes Toothless Compulsory Voting Increase Turnout?
