Howdy! I am Reshi Rajan, a first year PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://bush.tamu.edu/pols/) at Texas A&M University's [Bush School of Government](https://bush.tamu.edu/) in College Station, Texas. My research interests are primarily in the intersection of comparative political behavior & institutions — specifically the effects institutional arrangements have on voters — and quantitative methodology — particularly maximum likelihood estimation with spatial and time-series cross-sectional data. I completed my B.A. in [International Affairs](https://spia.uga.edu/) with a minor in [Mathematics](https://www.math.uga.edu/) from the University of Georgia in 2023 as well as my M.A. in [Political Science](https://spia.uga.edu/degree/master-of-arts-ma-in-political-science-international-affairs/). In addition to my research interests in political science, my interests in pure mathematics focus on Number Theory, specifically arithmetic in the Quaternions.
